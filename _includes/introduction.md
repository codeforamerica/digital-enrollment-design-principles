# Design Principles for Digital Enrollment

## Toward a simple, respectful and relevant digital experience for every person seeking government assistance in a time of need, in all 50 states.

## The Challenge
Somewhere between 15 - 40% of people who are eligible to enroll in programs like SNAP, Medicaid and TANF are not participating in these programs,  due in large part to the onerous application, enrollment and renewal processes. People seeking to enroll in government safety net programs are met with frustrating digital tools,  confusing communications, and poor in-person experiences.

A [recent user research study](https://medium.com/the-u-s-digital-service/redesigning-the-journey-to-critical-benefits-for-americans-in-poverty-2ca068591f32) conducted by CMS and the U.S. Digital Service offers detailed insight into the human experience of Eligibility and Enrollment (E&E) systems. We now understand more about the enrollment process from the perspective of applicants: key transactions are arduous, relevant information is difficult to access or understand, and modes of communication don’t match the way people functionally live and work.

This research tells us that in order to successfully enroll in our services, applicants need:

- The ability to determine eligibility and apply for programs in as few steps as possible;
- Useful information that is straightforward, easily accessible, and clearly presented;
- Tools that are easy to find and use, with consistent information across multiple channels;
- Notifications and feedback loops that are reliable, timely and easy to understand.

Meanwhile, the environment in which we are working to address these needs is complex:

- Fifty-one unique state E&E systems serve people across the United States, each of which needs to meet both federal guidelines as well as adhere to and integrate with state- pecific programs and policies;
- Modernization efforts are hampered by strained budgets, lengthy procurement procedures and a limited vendor ecosystem.
- Technology norms, standards and consumer habits are rapidly changing.

## Introducing Digital Enrollment Design Principles

To help state E&E modernization projects accelerate their efforts to overcome some of these challenges, we have devised a list of ten design principles for creating efficient, user-centered digital safety net applications.

These principles are informed by rigorous research into the behaviors and needs of safety net program applicants, design and testing of multiple prototypes and enrollment services, and best practice from the private sector’s design and technical domain. They expand upon the objectives published by [CMS’s Medicaid Information Technology Architecture (MITA 3.0)](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/data-and-systems/mita/mita-30/index.html) and are built on the foundation of much progress in the digital government sector over the past 5 years. We strongly encourage all E&E modernization teams to familiarize themselves with these foundational guides:

- [The U.S. Digital Service Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov)
- [The U.K.’s GDS Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
- [The U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs Digital Playbook](https://www.vets.gov/playbook/)

## How to use the design principles

The principles in this playbook are intended to help state and local safety net eligibility and enrollment teams frame, approach and design their digital enrollment systems.  It is focused primarily on the digital interface for an online multi-benefit application -- though its tenants can be applied to individual programs as well.

This guide is designed to be used in partnership with current and future contractors who may be supporting the development of these systems.  We encourage state leaders to make use of this tool when scoping new efforts, evaluating existing work, and procuring new services. Share it widely with your teams.
